Adds back 'Notes' button to OkCupid

Inspired by jbx0 on Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1kl3xc/bringing_back_notes_with_a_bookmarklet_a_howto/

Currently available as a Greasemonkey script and a Chrome extension.

Greasemonkey script can also be found here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/176001

Chrome extension not in webstore yet and requires files are checked out and that Chrome is pointed to the chrome/ folder.  TODO: replace icons.


Pull requests welcome.
