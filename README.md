_Update January 2015: OkCupid removed existing notes and broke this script awhile ago; pretty sure this script is dead now._






OkCupid recently removed the 'Notes' button.  This project adds it back.

Inspired by jbx0 on Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1kl3xc/bringing_back_notes_with_a_bookmarklet_a_howto/

Currently available as a Greasemonkey script and as a Chrome extension.

The Greasemonkey script can also be found here: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/176001

The Chrome extension can be downloaded from the webstore here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gbcoffndindolafepaoogjncijiempep/ or can be installed manually by checking out files and pointing Chrome to the chrome/ folder.


Pull requests welcome.
