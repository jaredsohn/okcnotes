Adds back 'Notes button' to OkCupid

Inspired by jbx0 on Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1kl3xc/bringing_back_notes_with_a_bookmarklet_a_howto/


Currently a Chrome extension.  To install, check out files and point to the manifest.  Will be in Chrome webstore and have a better icon soon (and perhaps work for other browsers and other changes).
